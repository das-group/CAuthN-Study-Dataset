Hello and thank you 
for participating in our survey! 

00:04.000 --> 00:10.000
It's about continuous authentication 
on social media websites or mobile apps. 

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
In the following, 
we will explain what this means.

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
Before you can use your favorite social media website or mobile app, 
you must sign in, usually with a username and password.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
After that, you can use the app until you log yourself out 
or you are automatically logged out.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
If an unauthorized person gains access 
to the device where you are logged into the service, 

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
they can use your account on your behalf. 

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
To prevent this, the provider of the social media website 
or mobile app could continuously check 

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
whether it is actually you who is 
using the service while you are logged in. 

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
For this purpose, the provider can use a variety of 
characteristics that are related to your person. 

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
These so-called biometric traits can 
either be collected with sensors 

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
or are obtained through your interaction with the device, 

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
like the way you are using a keyboard, 
a mouse, or many other traits.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
In this survey, we would like to know how you would feel about providing your 
biometric traits to protect your social media account.
